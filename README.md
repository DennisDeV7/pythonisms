# LAB - 42


## Project: Pythonisms

## Author: Dennis DeVries

## Setup

with active virtual environment, run tests: `pytest`

run example decorator: `python decorators/deco.py`

## Findings

Firstly I found when I started experimenting with it, that pytest sometimes doesn't like the decorators. That could very well just be a me problem, however. Learning about this exposed a new world of things I did not know about and new built in libraries I did not know about. For example, the "test" module has so many methods involving time. I wrote a decorator that calculates the time that a function takes to execute.
